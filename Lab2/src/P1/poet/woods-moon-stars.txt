In the tranquil woods embrace
where the whispers of nature echo softly
there are ancient trees
tall and proud
standing as guardians of the forest's secrets
Stars shimmer in the endless sky
their twinkling lights casting a gentle glow upon the earth below
A lone nightingale
perched amidst the branches
sweetly sings its melodious song
its melodious voice blending seamlessly with the symphony of the night
In this serene sanctuary
where time seems to stand still
one can find solace in the beauty of the natural world
and perhaps
discover the magic that resides within
